## Dataset Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. <br>
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly <br>
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.<br>
 1. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)<br>
    wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
 2. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular <br>
    velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
 3. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected <br>
    for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
 4. The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a <br>
     Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
 5. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff<br>
    frequency was used. 
 6. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
 7. For each record in the dataset it is provided:
	   - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
	   - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
	   - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
	   - Its activity label.
	   - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
